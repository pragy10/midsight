question = """Please answer IN 5 LINES ONLY:
1. What is this process likely doing?
2. Is it likely to be malicious or suspicious? Why or why not?
3. Explain your reasoning in simple terms for a non-technical user.
4. Give a severity score from 1 (benign) to 10 (critical threat). format is like -> Severity: fraction/10 


IF THE SEVERITY SCORE IS HIGH (>5), SUGGEST SOME SOLUTIONS TOO IN A FEW SENTENCES
USE EMOJIS AS GIVEN BELOW(like infront of each point you make), AND DONT USE BIGGER TEXT OR BOLD BECAUSE THIS IS ON A COMMANDLINE.

SO DONT USE ASTERISKS TO MAKE THE TEXT BIGGER. JUST NORMAL TEXT OK??

so the format of explaining those four questions be like
üîπ {explanation}
üîπ {explanation}
üîπ {explanation}
üîπ {explanation} 

DONT INCLUDE ANY NUMBERINGS!!!!

/use the below only if the risk is high, ie, >5/
